# Waypoints

Waypoints are specific locations or points within a map that are used as reference points for guiding a robot. They serve as targets or intermediate destinations that the robot aims to reach during its operation. Waypoints play a crucial role in defining paths, routes, or missions for the robot to follow.

Each waypoint has a specific position defined by its coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The position represents the spatial location where the robot should move or reach. In addition to the position, waypoints also have an orientation associated with them. The orientation indicates the direction or angle the robot should face or align with when it reaches the waypoint.

In the following sections, we will more systematically understand the following concepts:
