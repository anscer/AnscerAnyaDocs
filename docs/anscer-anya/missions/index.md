# Missions

A Mission typically involves a sequence of tasks that the robot needs to execute in order to complete the mission successfully. These tasks can include actions such as picking up and delivering items, moving to specific waypoints, interacting with objects, or performing other designated actions as required by the mission.

In the following sections, we will more systematically understand the following concepts:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
