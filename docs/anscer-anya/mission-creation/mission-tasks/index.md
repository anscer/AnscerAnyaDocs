# Mission Tasks

Mission tasks are individual actions or steps within a mission. These tasks are designed to accomplish specific objectives, whether they involve movement, interaction, processing, or any other action that the robot is capable of performing.

Mission tasks are executed in a predefined sequence or based on programmed instructions to fulfill the overall mission's goals efficiently and autonomously. They are the building blocks that enable a robot to complete complex operations and tasks within its operational environment.

## Types of Mission Tasks

Mission tasks encompass a wide range of actions that a robot can perform within a mission.

- **Movement Tasks**: Tasks related to the robot's movement and navigation, including:

  - **_Move_**: Basic movement from one point to another.
  - **_Charge_**: Initiating the robot's charging process.
  - **_Multi-Waypoint_**: Navigating through fixed path waypoints.
  - **_QR Marker_**: Utilizing QR markers for navigation.

- **Process Tasks**: Tasks involving various robotic processes, including:

  - **_Lifter_**: Actions related to lifting or elevating objects.
  - **_Conveyor_**: Interactions with conveyor systems.
  - **_Turn Table_**: Operations involving turntables.
  - **_Manipulator_**: Actions performed by robot manipulators.
  - **_Docking_**: Procedures for docking with specific stations.
  - **_Un-Docking_**: Procedures for undocking from stations.

- **Interaction Tasks**: Tasks focused on interactions and communication:

  - **_Wait_**: Pausing or waiting for specific conditions or user input.
