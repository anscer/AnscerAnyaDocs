# Sidebar

The ANSCER ANYA user interface includes a Sidebar Menu that provides convenient access to various sections and functionalities of the application.

Here is a comprehensive description of the options available in the Sidebar:

## Create

The Create option allows users to create and manage all the resources in ANSCER ANYA, as: **Maps**, **Waypoints**, **Zones**, **Missions**, **Users**, for the ANSCER Robots.

Clicking on the Create option opens a sub menu with appropriate options, where users can create or manage resources for Robot.

### Maps

Maps provide a visual representation of the robot's surroundings, allowing Robot to understand and interpret the environment. By capturing information about obstacles, walls, objects, and other features, maps enable the robot to navigate and interact with its surroundings effectively. Maps provide important information for navigation, localization, and path planning.

Maps help the robot navigate autonomously, plan efficient paths, and avoid collisions.

### Zones

In the context of Anscer ANYA, zones refer to specific areas or regions within a map that are defined for different purposes or characteristics. A zone can be thought of as a designated space with a specific set of attributes or properties assigned to it.

Robots can detect and respond to zone boundaries or triggers. Depending on the zone type, the robot may adjust its behavior, issue warnings, change speed, or avoid restricted areas.

### Waypoints

Waypoints are specific locations or points within a map or navigation system that are used as reference points for guiding a robot or an autonomous system. They serve as targets or intermediate destinations that the robot aims to reach during its operation. Waypoints play a crucial role in defining paths, routes, or missions for the robot to follow.

### Missions

A mission typically involves a sequence of tasks that the robot needs to execute in order to complete the mission successfully. These tasks can include actions such as picking up and delivering items, moving to specific waypoints, interacting with objects, or performing other designated actions as required by the mission.

### Users

The Users option provides functionality for managing user accounts within ANSCER ANYA.

Users with appropriate permissions can create, edit, and manage user accounts for individuals accessing the application.

## Monitor

The Monitor section is divided into two main parts: **Analytics** and **Diagnostics**. These parts provide valuable insights and information about the performance and status of the ANSCER Robots.

Here is a comprehensive description of each part:

### Analytics

- The Analytics part of the Monitor section provides data-driven insights and visualizations related to the robot's activities.
- It presents key metrics, charts, and graphs that offer a comprehensive overview of the robot's performance, efficiency, and productivity.
- Users can explore metrics such as mission completion rates, task durations, resource utilization, or any other relevant data points.
- This feature enables users to gain valuable insights into the overall performance and effectiveness of the ANSCER Robots.

### Diagnostics

- The Diagnostics part of the Monitor section focuses on providing detailed information about the operational status of the ANSCER Robots.
- It offers real-time monitoring and reporting of various aspects, including system health, sensor readings, error logs, or any potential issues.

- This feature allows users to proactively detect and resolve issues, ensuring the smooth functioning of the ANSCER Robots.

## Settings

The Settings option provides access to various configuration settings for the ANSCER Robots. Users can configure and customize the application to suit their specific requirements.

These settings are specifically related to the ANSCER Robots and their interactions with the application.

## Help
