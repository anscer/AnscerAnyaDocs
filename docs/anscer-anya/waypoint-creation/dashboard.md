# Dashboard

Here we will be exploring the **Waypoint Creator** interface of ANSCER ANYA. It covers the various tools, controls, and features available to users for waypoint creation. We will learn how to navigate and understand its different elements to make the most out of the waypoint creation process.

Waypoint creator dashboard consists of the following components:

## Waypoint Visualization

Waypoint Visualization provides you a comprehensive view of the waypoints, zones and map you are working. It also shows the Laser scan from Robot for more accurate waypoint creation.

## Tools and Features

### Zoom In

This tool allows you to zoom in on the map, providing a closer view of the area you are working on.

### Zoom Out

This tool enables you to zoom out on the map, providing a broader view of the entire area.

### Fullscreen

This feature allows you to view the map in full-screen mode, maximizing the available screen space. It provides a larger workspace for better visualization and interaction.

### Initiliaze Robot

The **"Initialize Robot"** tool is a crucial step to guarantee precise robot positioning within its physical surroundings. Prior to creating a waypoint, it's imperative to use this tool to ensure the robot's accurate placement, which is essential for obtaining precise waypoint positions. This process enhances the overall accuracy and effectiveness of navigation and mission control.

> **The tool is conveniently located at the top right corner of the map viewer.**

For more information on the **"Initialize Robot"** tool, see [**Initialize Robot**](../features/initialization).

### Quick Goal

The "Quick Goal" tool, provides a convenient way to instantly dispatch a robot to a desired location for waypoint creation. Sending a **quick goal** for creating a waypoint offers a more efficient approach, leveraging the robot's autonomous navigation capabilities. This simplifies the process, allowing to specify waypoints with precision without manually driving the robot.

> **The tool is conveniently located at the top right corner of the map viewer.**

For more information on the **"Quick Goal"** tool, see [**Quick Goal**](../features/quick-goal).

## "Create Waypoint" Button

**“Create Waypoint”** button is visible when you are creating a new Waypoint. It saves the newly created Waypoint when clicked.

## "Update Waypoint" Button

**“Update Waypoint”** button is visible when you update an existing Waypoint. It Updates the changes done to the Waypoint.

## Layer Control

Layer control is used to toggle the visibility of different map layers. It allows users to selectively display or hide various layers([**Waypoints**](/docs/anscer-anya/waypoints/dashboard), [**Zones**](/docs/anscer-anya/zones/dashboard) and [**Laser Scan**](../features/laser-scan)) on the map.

## Joystick

- A Joystick is located at the bottom right corner of the screen. It is used to manually move the Robot. For more information on the Joystick, see [**Joystick**](../features/joystick).
