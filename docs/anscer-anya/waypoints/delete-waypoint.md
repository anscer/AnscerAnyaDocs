# Delete Waypoint

Please note that **Deleting a waypoint** is a permanent action, and once deleted, it cannot be undone.

## Steps to Delete a Waypoint

- Navigate to the **Waypoint dashboard**.
- Locate or search the waypoint you want to delete in the waypoint list.
- Look for the delete icon associated with the waypoint, which is typically located at the end represented by a trash bin.
- Click on the delete icon for the respective waypoint.
- A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to confirm the deletion.
- Confirm the deletion by clicking on the **Delete** button.
- The waypoint will be removed from the waypoint list and deleted from the system.

:::danger
Deleting a waypoint means permanently removing it from the system. This action is irreversible, and once a waypoint is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is essential to double-check before confirming the deletion to avoid unintentionally removing a waypoint.
:::
:::caution
Deleting a waypoint will have significant consequences, when you delete a waypoint, it will invalidate all missions that depend on that specific waypoint. Any ongoing or planned tasks involving that waypoint will be disrupted.
:::
:::tip
Instead of deleting a waypoint, it's often more advisable to [**update**](../waypoint-creation/edit-waypoint) it, especially when waypoint position adjustments are needed. Here's why updating is a better practice:

- Updating waypoints allows you to make necessary adjustments while retaining the continuity of missions that rely on those waypoints. This prevents mission disruption.
- Updating waypoints is a more efficient way to make changes to waypoints. It's faster and more convenient than deleting and creating a new waypoint. By this you need to find and update all the missions that rely on that waypoint.
