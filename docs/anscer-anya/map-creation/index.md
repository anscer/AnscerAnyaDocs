# Map Creation/Mapping

Map Creation/Mapping is the process of creating a map of the environment in which the robot will operate. The map is created by driving the robot around the environment and allowing it to record the environment's features. The robot will use these features to create a map of the environment. The map is then saved and can be loaded for use with the robot.

In the following sections, we will more systematically understand the Map Creation/Mapping process and the following concepts:
