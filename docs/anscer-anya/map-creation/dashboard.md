# Mapping Dashboard

Here we will be exploring the **Mapping** interface of ANSCER ANYA. It covers the various tools, controls, and features available to users for map creation. We will learn how to navigate the mapping interface and understand its different elements to make the most out of the map creation process.

Mapping dashboard consists of the following components:

## Map Visualization

Map Visualization provides you a comprehensive view of the map you are creating. It shows the Laser scan and obstacles present in the environment.

## Tools and Features

### Zoom In

This tool allows you to zoom in on the map, providing a closer view of the area you are working on.

### Zoom Out

This tool enables you to zoom out on the map, providing a broader view of the entire area.

### Fullscreen

This feature allows you to view the map in full-screen mode, maximizing the available screen space. It provides a larger workspace for better visualization and interaction.

## "Start Mapping" Button

**“Start Mapping**” button is visible when you are on the **Mapping Screen** but have not started Mapping. It initiates the process of mapping.

## "Cancel" Button

**“Cancel”** button is used to cancel the mapping process.

## "Save Map" Button

**“Save Map”** button is visible when you are on the **Mapping Screen** and have started Mapping. It saves the newly created map.

## Joystick

- A Joystick is located at the bottom right corner of the screen. It is used to control the robot's movements during the mapping process. For more information on the Joystick, see [**Joystick**](../features/joystick).
