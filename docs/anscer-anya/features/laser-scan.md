# Laser scan

In application, the visible laser scan on top of the map serves as a visual representation of the robot's environment. This scan provides real-time data on the surroundings and is a key element in assessing the accuracy of the robot's localization. By analyzing the laser scan data, users can gauge how well the robot is perceiving its environment, which is vital for ensuring precise navigation and localization. It acts as a valuable tool for monitoring and improving the robot's operational accuracy and safety.

:::info
Laser Scan typically generated by a Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor, which is mounted on the Robot.

If Laser Scan is not available, the Robot will not be able to localize itself and navigate autonomously.
