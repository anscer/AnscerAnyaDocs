# Robot Mode

Robot Mode refers to the operational state or configuration of ANSCER Robots, offering distinct settings to suit different operational needs and scenarios. ANSCER Robots provide three primary modes: Auto, Manual, and Brake Release, each serving a specific purpose within the robot's functionality:

## Auto/Automatic Mode

In Auto Mode, the robot operates autonomously, following predefined instructions and tasks without direct human intervention. It leverages its sensors, maps, and algorithms to navigate, perform tasks, and execute missions efficiently and accurately.

## Manual Mode

Manual Mode allows human operators to take direct control of the robot's movements and actions. It offers a hands-on approach, enabling operators to steer the robot, guide its movements, and perform tasks manually. Operator can control the robot by using the [**Joystick**](./joystick).

## Brake Release Mode

Brake Release mode in ANSCER Robots facilitates manual movement by allowing users to push or pull the robot to a desired location. This mode is particularly valuable during tasks such as transportation, packing, or unpacking, where manual handling is required. By releasing the brakes, the robot becomes mobile and can be easily maneuvered to a new position, simplifying logistical processes and ensuring flexibility in robot deployment.

## How to change Robot Mode

To change the robot mode, you can use the physical rotary switch button located on the robot. This switch allows you to select between the available modes, such as Auto, Manual, and Brake Release, depending on your operational requirements. Simply rotate the switch to the desired mode position to initiate the mode change, enabling you to adapt the robot's behavior and control method as needed for different tasks and scenarios.
