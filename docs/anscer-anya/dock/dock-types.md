# Types of Dock

Here is a comprehensive description of the available docking types:

## ChArUco

ChArUco pattern is a special visual code that the robot's camera can read. The pattern helps the robot determine its position and orientation accurately. By analyzing the pattern, the robot's software can calculate the exact movements it needs to make to align itself correctly with the docking station.

## Reflector

Reflector docking relies on the reflection of light or other signals to guide the robot during docking. Reflective materials or markers on the docking station help the robot determine its position.

## Trolley

The robot gracefully maneuvers beneath the trolley, aligns its lifting mechanisms. The robot autonomously aligns itself with the trolley for attachment.

## VL Marker

VL (Visual Landmark) markers are visual cues placed on docking stations. Robots use to identify and navigate toward these markers for precise docking.

It is commonly used in scenarios where high-precision alignment is essential, such as robotic assembly lines.

## Ground Marker

Ground markers are placed on the floor and serve as reference points for the robot's navigation and docking. The robot uses these markers for alignment.

## Side-Wise

Side-wise docking marker is a type of marker used for Robot docking that helps robots align and position themselves accurately when they need to dock or connect with objects or locations from the side.These markers are usually placed on the side surface where the robot needs to dock. Side-wise docking markers can be signs with unique shapes or patterns that the robot's camera/lidar can easily understand.

## Two Point Marker

Two-point marker docking involves the use of two distinct markers or points on the docking station. The robot uses these points for alignment and docking.

Each of these types of docking serves unique purposes and caters to specific operational needs, ensuring that Robots can effectively perform tasks or exchange payloads in various environments. The choice of docking method depends on factors such as precision requirements, environmental conditions, and operational constraints.
