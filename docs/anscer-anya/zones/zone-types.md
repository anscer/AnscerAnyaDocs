# Types of Zone

It's important to note that these zone types are only applicable during the robot's automatic operation, such as when it is following a mission or a quick goal. In manual mode, the robot can freely traverse through any zone without the specific behaviors or restrictions associated with these zones.

## Restricted Zone

This type of zone is marked on the map to restrict the robot from passing through it when it is operating in automatic mode, such as during a mission or when given a quick goal. The robot will avoid entering this zone and find an alternative path.

## Warning Zone

When the robot enters a warning zone during its automatic operation, it will display a warning message on the user interface (UI) screen. This zone serves as an alert to notify the user or operator about the robot's presence in the designated area.

## Blink Zone

The robot will start blinking when it enters a blink zone during automatic operation. This visual indication helps draw attention to the fact that the robot is passing through this specific area.

## Buzzer Zone

When the robot enters a buzzer zone, it will activate a buzzer sound to audibly alert the user or operator. This feature can be used to bring attention to the robot's presence in the designated area.

## Speed Zone

In a speed zone, the robot will reduce its speed, moving more slowly than usual while passing through this area during automatic operation. This can be helpful in areas where slower movement is desired or required.

## No-Plan Zone

The robot is allowed to pass through a no-plan zone when no other feasible path or option is available for the robot to reach its destination during automatic operation. It serves as a fallback option for the robot to navigate through areas where there may not be any predefined plans or paths.
