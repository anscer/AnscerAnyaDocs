# Create Waypoint

## Steps to Create a Waypoint

- Navigate to the Waypoint Creation Screen
- Manually drive the Robot using [**Joystick**](../features/joystick) or give a [**Quick Goal**](../features/quick-goal) to the desired location where you want to create the waypoint.
- Click on the **"Create Waypoint"** button present at the top-right side of the screen.
- A confirmation dialog will appear, In the confirmation dialog, enter a name for the waypoint and select the appropriate waypoint type i.e. [**Normal Waypoint**](../waypoints/waypoint-types/#normal-waypoint), [**Special Waypoint**](../waypoints/waypoint-types/#special-waypoint), [**Charging Waypoint**](../waypoints/waypoint-types/#charging-waypoint) and [**Home Waypoint**](../waypoints/waypoint-types/#home-waypoint).
- If you select Special or Charging Waypoint, you will need to select the appropriate [**Docking Marker type**](../dock/dock-types) from the available options.
- If you select Normal Waypoint or Home Waypoint, there will be no further options. Simply enter the name of the waypoint.
- Click on the **"Confirm"** button to create the waypoint.

:::info
We can only create a waypoint in the current Robot position. If you want to create a waypoint at a different location, you will need to move the robot to that location first. This will ensure that the waypoint is created at the correct location, where Robot can navigate to.
