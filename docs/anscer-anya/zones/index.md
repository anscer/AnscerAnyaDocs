# Zones

Zones refer to specific areas or regions within a map that are defined for different purposes or characteristics. A zone can be thought of as a designated space with a specific set of attributes or properties assigned to it.

Robots can detect and respond to zone boundaries or triggers. Depending on the zone type, the robot may adjust its behavior, issue warnings, change speed, or avoid restricted areas.

They enhance safety by preventing the robot from entering restricted or potentially hazardous areas. It also help optimize robot workflows by specifying where tasks should be executed.

In the following sections, we will more systematically understand the following concepts:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
