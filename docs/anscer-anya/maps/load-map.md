# Load Map

When it comes to loading a map in the Anscer ANYA software, it typically involves retrieving a previously saved map and making it available for use with the robot.

- Find the map in the map list or use the search feature to locate it.
- If using the search feature, enter relevant keywords or the map's name to filter the map list.
- Select the desired map from the list by clicking on it.
- Click on the "**Load**" button (located in bottom of the list) to initiate the loading process.
- This is a two-step process, and the user will be prompted to confirm the loading of the map.
- The software will begin loading the selected map.
- Once the map is loaded, it will be available for use with the Robot.
- After loading the map, proceed to localize the robot within the newly loaded map.
