# Dashboard

The Maps Dashboard is designed with a user-friendly interface to provide convenient access to map visualization and data management. It consists of two main columns that serve distinct purposes:

## Map Visualization

The left column of the Maps Dashboard is dedicated to map visualization. It offers a comprehensive view of the map, including zones and waypoints. Users can interact with the map to explore and navigate different areas of interest. The Map Preview provides a visual representation of the environment, allowing users to gain insights into the layout and features of the mapped area.

## Maps Data Table

The right column of the Maps Dashboard focuses on map data management. It provides a set of data tables equipped with various features and functionalities to effectively manage map-related information.

The main components of the Map Data Tables section include:

### Search Type Select

With search type users can further refine their search for map data by utilizing search type options. These search type options allow users to specify the criteria they want to use when searching for maps.

### Search Bar

The search bar allows users to quickly search and filter specific map-related data based on search types. It enables users to easily locate and access the desired map data within the table.

### View Button

- The Maps Data Table provides an additional feature called the "View" button. This button allows to customize the visibility of columns in the table rows, enabling them to focus on the essential information and hide any extra properties they do not need to see at all times.
- Clicking on the "View" button, opens a menu with a list of available columns. Each column represents a specific property or attribute associated with the maps in the table.
- Within the menu, users can toggle the visibility of columns by selecting or deselecting the corresponding options. When a column is deselected, it is hidden from the table rows, reducing clutter and improving the readability of the data.

### Map Table
