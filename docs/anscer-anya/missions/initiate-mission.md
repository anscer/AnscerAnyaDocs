:::info
The **"Iteration count"** represents the number of times the robot is required to repeat the same sequence of tasks. There is default value of 1 or value provided at the time of [**Mission Creation**](../mission-creation/create-mission) for the iteration count. If you want the robot to repeat the same sequence of tasks multiple times, you can update the iteration count from the confirmation dialog.
