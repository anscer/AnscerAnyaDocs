# Create Map

Before proceeding with mapping, ensure that the robot is in **Manual Mode**, neither in automatic nor brake release mode. This allows you to manually control the robot's movements during the mapping process.

- From the **Maps dashboard**, click on the "**Create New Map**" button present top right side.
- You will be redirected to the [**Mapping Screen**](/docs/anscer-anya/map-creation/dashboard).
