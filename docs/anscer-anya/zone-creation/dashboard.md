# Dashboard

Here we will be exploring the **Zone Creator** interface of ANSCER ANYA. It covers the various tools, controls, and features available to users for zone creation. We will learn how to navigate and understand its different elements to make the most out of the zone creation process.

Zone creator dashboard consists of the following components:

## Zone Visualization

Zone Visualization provides you a comprehensive view of the zones and map you are working. It also shows the Laser scan from Robot for more accurate zone creation.

## Tools and Features

### Zoom In

This tool allows you to zoom in on the map, providing a closer view of the area you are working on.

### Zoom Out

This tool enables you to zoom out on the map, providing a broader view of the entire area.

### Fullscreen

This feature allows you to view the map in full-screen mode, maximizing the available screen space. It provides a larger workspace for better visualization and interaction.

### Create Zone Tools

There are few tools availabe while creating a zone:

#### Polyline

This tool is to create a zone using multiple connected lines. You can start by placing the first node, then continue adding additional nodes to define the shape of the zone. Each line segment will be connected to the previous one, forming a polyline.

#### Polygon

The polygon tool is to create a zone using a closed polygon shape. To create a polygon, you need to click on the map to set the nodes of the shape. Start by placing the first node, then continue adding nodes by clicking on the desired locations. Finally, you need to click on the first node again to close the polygon and complete the zone.

#### Circle Marker

With the circle marker tool, you can create a zone by selecting a point on the map.

### Update Zone Tools

There are another set of tools availabe while updating a zone:

#### Edit

This tool allows you to reshape the zone by adjusting the position of its nodes or vertices. You can click and drag the nodes to modify the shape and size of the zone.

#### Drag

With the drag tool, you can move the entire zone to a different location on the map. Click and hold within the zone, then drag it to the desired position.

#### Cut

The cut tool enables you to remove a portion of the zone by creating a polygon around the area you want to exclude. Once you draw the polygon, the selected area will be removed from the zone.

#### Rotate

The rotate tool allows you to rotate the zone around its center point. You can click on the zone and use the rotation handle to adjust its orientation.

## "Save Zone" Button

**“Save Zone”** button is available when you are creating a new zone.

## "Update Zone" Button

**“Update Zone”** button is visible when you edit an existing Zone. It Updates the changes done to the zone.

## Layer Control

Layer control is used to toggle the visibility of different map layers. It allows users to selectively display or hide various layers([**Waypoints**](/docs/anscer-anya/waypoints/dashboard), [**Zones**](/docs/anscer-anya/zones/dashboard) and [**Laser Scan**](../features/laser-scan)) on the map.

## Joystick

- A Joystick is located at the bottom right corner of the screen. It is used to manually move the Robot. For more information on the Joystick, see [**Joystick**](../features/joystick).
