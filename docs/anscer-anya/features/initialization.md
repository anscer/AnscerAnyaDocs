# Initialization/Initialize Robot

The process of initializing a robot involves manually informing the robot about its current position and orientation within the physical environment. This is necessary when the robot loses its localization due to various factors, causing it to stop navigating accurately. Delocalization can be detected when discrepancies arise between the robot's map boundaries and the laser scan data generated by its LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors. When these do not match or overlap properly, it indicates a loss of positional awareness.

To rectify this, the robot's operator or user must perform an initialization procedure. This typically includes physically placing the robot at a known location within the environment and providing it with reference data to reestablish its position and orientation. Once initialized, the robot can resume its navigation tasks with accurate localization information, ensuring safe and efficient operation within the physical space. Initialization is a critical step in maintaining the robot's reliability and performance, especially when faced with localization challenges or delocalization events.
