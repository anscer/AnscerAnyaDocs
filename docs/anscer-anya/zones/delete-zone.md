# Delete Zone

Please note that **Deleting a zone** is a permanent action, and once deleted, it cannot be undone.

## Steps to Delete a Zone

- Navigate to the **Zone dashboard**.
- Locate or search the zone you want to delete in the zone list.
- Look for the delete icon associated with the zone, which is typically located at the end represented by a trash bin.
- Click on the delete icon for the respective zone.
- A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to confirm the deletion.
- Confirm the deletion by clicking on the **Delete** button.
- The zone will be removed from the zone list and deleted from the system.

Deleting a zone means permanently removing it from the system. This action is irreversible, and once a zone is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is essential to double-check before confirming the deletion to avoid unintentionally removing a zone.

:::tip
Rather than deleting zones outright, it's often more advisable to deactivate them, as users may need those zones again in the future. Here are the key reasons why deactivation is a better approach:

- Deactivating a zone preserves its configuration, including boundary coordinates, associated parameters, and any special rules. This can save time and effort when reactivating the zone later.
- Deactivated zones can be easily reactivated when needed, eliminating the need to recreate them from scratch. This can be particularly useful if the zone's purpose remains consistent.
- Keeping zones available for reactivation helps maintain the continuity of operations, as you won't have to reconfigure the robot's behavior or tasks associated with those zones.
